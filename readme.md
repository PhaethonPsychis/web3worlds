# Future Web3 World Vision.
## To build the future, first, we must visualize it.


#### 1. Collective Decentralized Participation
This project proposes to the community to participate in the making of the Future Web3-World Vision to create many shared visions and form the future. The project will envision an array of city worlds at three, fifteen and fifty year time horizons starting from 2022. The project will explore possible future scenarios integrating web3 technologies in different degrees and levels. 
Digital assets serve as part of the decentralized and integrated storytelling process allowing fans to shape their own scenario for the future pushing whatâ€™s possible with web3. Members will gain access to an unprecedented three-year journey that takes place on-chain. Members will be able to  vote on key aspects of the project, including storyline, characters, and to help drive the ongoing narrative of the future. 


#### 2. Future Worlds
Future Web3 World Vision is looking inside deeply researched, wholly plausible future worlds, allowing communities to plan for tomorrow with the web3 technologies of today. The Super City of 50+ million people, a Climate-positive World, and a future reality where the entire population of a city is connected to a web3 system enabling cyber to physical world interactions through access to real-world data are some of the worlds introduced.

#### 4. Deliverables
Each prototype produces outcomes across multiple platforms. Using high fidelity media, and a visual language we can all understand we can show people that other realities are possible and that web3 can help us get there. If we map the path to a brighter future, many will join to work towards that outcome.

#### 5. World Systems Design
Web3 Worlds Vision is not science fiction. The world system is built from a network of web3 institutions that form the rules of the future world. The interactions of people with institutions create societies that exhibit a multitude of complex behaviours under different conditions. These new worlds are future realities because the starting conditions are anchored in the current state and they evolve based on the design of the institutions. 

#### 6. Programmable Web3 has become a future reality system. Any world we prototype Communities can bring into existence. <br>
Programmable Web3 can edit, re-program, and redesign components, systems, and interactions that make up social, economic, and political systems. "Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade." This demonstrates the disrupting power of communities to bring future realities into existence with the use of web3 systems within the online internet environment. By pairing elements of the physical world with digital assets it is possible to create interactions and systems between realities that can serve as the operating system of entire cities.

## Project Rationale

##### 1. Why explore web3 potential
The idea that web3  can inform the design of alternative futures, and that communities can use web3 systems to provoke desired realities into existence is a powerful one to explore. 
##### 1. How to explore
the TINKCAN TOKEN, a design research pilot exploring the potential and capacity of the programmable web3 to inform the strategic design of, and transition towards, collective futures that are good for the Earth: climate-positive worlds, super cities ... are obvious futures
 interactive cyber-physical policy systems 


### The problems to solve
Yet community-led and owned, open-source design research activity does not exist.<br> nor 
there are no token incentives in place to reward contributors.<br>
What questions this project will answer<br>
How to design the future of web3? <br>
How to explore the potential of web3 to its fullest extent?
together with the community?<br> participate in the
and How to avoid the biases of the few when exploring the plausible futures of web3 that can be made available? <br>
How can communities leverage the programmable web3 to bring future realities into existence?<br>
How can we help society envision solutions to long-term global challenges, get exposure, and experience future realities?<br>
How can we form our world into the one we want rather than the one that may be available to us in the face of mass challenges?<br>
There are three main motivations as to why we need to explore the potential of web3 to its full extent, why use a decentralized worldbuilding method to do it, and the new incentives mechanism.

Web3 institutions and cyber to physical systems have a wide range of applications that could transform society and the global economy. 

### SYNTHETIC WEB3 WORLDS 
##### Intro
Web3 Synthetic Worlds pair language and Narrative with programmable blocks. This combination creates a unique and unparallel experimental environment that does not exist in other simulation systems except from digital games. They enable the testing of socio-economic and political systems at scale. With the use of language and narratives we can transition the world from one state to another.<br>
Example: What conversations can emerge in...<br> These properties are unique among simulation environments and enable the testing of large scale projects before the project is built.<br>

Building prototypes of these worlds will enable communities and organizations to envision, experience, and explore desirable realities. and take the necessary steps now to realize these futures.<br>

##### Web3 world system
web3 protocols create the world system that allows the world to function, evolve and grow. In these "world prototypes" what could happen in the future is based on what protocols are deployed, and what is happening in the present.  
This world-building process employs narratives design within a container constructed with the technological framework of web3. 


In doing so, they allow us to not just tinker with the status quo, but to dismantle it and build something better in its place. 
Building projective futures we can show people that other realities are possible and that web3 can help us get there. If we can show that web3  can help to create a brighter future and we map the path to it, we will all rush towards that outcome or not.

##### A web3 world is a coordination system
Envisioning these worlds and the novel possibilities becoming available can serve as a coordination mechanism to demonstrate how web3 can become a central component of plausible futures. 

##### A web3 world is a map toward a future state
Worlds serve as a map of how to arrive at the future from the current state.
