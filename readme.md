# Future Web3 World Vision.
## To build the future, first, we must visualize it.


#### WEB3 WORLD PROTOTYPES PROVOKE CHANGE
This project proposes to the community to participate in the making of the Future Web3-World Vision to create many shared visions and form the future. The project will envision an array of city worlds at three, fifteen, and fifty-year time horizons starting from 2022. The project will explore possible future scenarios integrating web3 technologies in different degrees and levels. Digital assets serve as part of the decentralized and integrated storytelling process allowing fans to shape their scenario for the future pushing what’s possible with web3. Members will gain access to an unprecedented three-year journey that takes place on-chain. Members will be able to vote on key aspects of the project, including storyline, and characters, and to help drive the ongoing narrative of the future.

#### FUTURE WEB3 WORLDS
Future Web3 World Vision is looking inside deeply researched, wholly plausible future worlds, allowing communities to plan for tomorrow with the web3 technologies of today. The Super City of 50+ million people, a Climate-positive World, and a future reality where the entire population of a city is connected to a web3 system enabling cyber to physical world interactions through access to real-world data are some of the worlds introduced.

#### PROGRAMMABLE WEB3 HAS BECOME A FUTURE REALITY. ANY WEB3 WORLD WE IMAGINE WE CAN BRING INTO EXISTENCE <br>
Programmable Web3 can edit, re-program, and redesign components, systems, and interactions that make up social, economic, and political systems. "Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade." This demonstrates the disrupting power communities posses to use web3 systems within the online internet environment and bring alternative realities into existence.<br>
By accessing data from the real-world through a blockchain smart contract we can create pairs of physical elements with digital assets. With this new class of assets we can create novel organizations, complex policies, interactions and systems that operate between realities. 

#### SYNTHETIC WEB3 WORLDS 
Web3 Worlds Vision is not science fiction. Web3 Synthetic Worlds pair language and Narrative with programmable policies and digital assets. These prototypes create future realities because the starting conditions are anchored in the current state and they evolve based on the design of the institutions. What could happen in the future is based on what is happening in the present and how we program the institutions that will take us into the future. This is  the world system that allows the world to function, evolve and grow. With the world-system we can transition the future from one state to another.<br><br>
This combination creates an unparallel experimental environment that is novel and unique because it enables the design and testing of socio-economic and political systems, and of large scale projects. Prototypes enable us to understand the consequences of proposed actions before they are put into practice. In doing so, they allow us to not just tinker with the status quo, but to dismantle it and build something better in its place.<br><br>
A Prototype is a coordination tool to create a shared vision that can guide the development process and inspire people to take action. Envisioning these worlds and the novel possibilities becoming available serve as a coordination mechanism to demonstrate how web3 can become a central component of plausible futures. If we can show that web3  can help to create a brighter future and we map the path to it, we will all rush towards that outcome. Prototypes serve as a map of how to arrive at the future from the current state.

#### EACH PROTOTYPE PRODUCES OUTCOMES ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS
Using high fidelity media, and a visual language we can all understand we can show people that other realities are possible and that web3 can help us get there.
 
## Project Rationale

Exploring the potential of web3 to its fullest extent is highly valuable because we can identify a number of different plausible future scenarios, explore what impacts they could have, and identify promising paths for technologies and applications. Envisiong web3 will strengthen the foresight capacity of communities and their critical role in safe fuarding and shaping the web3 ecosystem.<br><br>
And yet community-led, open-source design research activity that combines strategic foresight with systems thinking and design do not exist. There is also a luck in resources and incentives to fund this strategic worldbuilding project.<br><br>
Because web3 is not a closed system it doesn’t offer reward mechanisms or token incentives to contributors as blockchains, applications or L2s can. We will have to put in place a number of funding mechanisms to attract talent, sponsors, and the community.<br><br>

At the center of this future design project is the decentralized and permissionles participation. The transformational power of web3 it is too complex and daunting for anyone to tackle alone. In this era of unprecedented change, no single team or organization can begin to design unexpected solutions that disrupt conventional thinking without deep collaboration between ecosystem developers, communities, and local governance.<br><br>

If we believe web3 empowers communities to design and form their future, then it is important to put in place incentives to attract talent to start working on the creation of prototypes and web3 worlds.<br>

#### PROTOCOL MECHANISMS
The Future Web3Worlds Vision aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a toolset that includes: <br>
   A protocol to ask for sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build the web3 ecosystem which gives sponsors exposure to the worldbuilding project.  Here’s a link to a project that inspired this protocol. <br>
   A membership token to enable the community to contribute to the project and reward participation.
