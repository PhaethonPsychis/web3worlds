# Future web3 worlds vision.
### To build the future, first, we must visualize it.
This project proposes to the community and web3 ecosystem to participate in the creation of Future Web3 Worlds Vision through integrated storytelling and curation. 
Web3 Worlds Vision is not science fiction. The scenario planning is built on top of a web3 rule system, anchored in the current state. Worlds start to evolve when citizens participate, to deliver future realities. 
Web3 Worlds Vision introduces multiple plausible worlds and their evolution from 2022 to 2070. <br><br>

Each world produces multiple outcomes accross platforms through compelling narratives, evocative designs. 
## Project Rationale
the TINKCAN TOKEN, a design research pilot exploring the potential and capacity of the programmable web3 to inform the strategic design of, and transition towards, collective futures that are good for the Earth: climate-positive worlds, super cities ... are obvious futures
 This project intends to bring to life the future of cyber-physical realities. 

The idea that web3  can inform the design of alternative futures, and that communities can use web3 systems to provoke desired realities into existence is a powerful one to explore. 
Tincan Token does this by constructing Synthetic Web3 Worlds through a Decentralized Worldbuilding process. It is a Design Research methodology, that Tincan Token develops,  
At the center of the web3 world-building process is the construction of worlds built on top of web3 rule systems. The created worlds are reality-based. The starting conditions are the current state and the world evolves according to a rule system defined by smart contracts and community interactions. 
Through compelling narratives and design.
We can experience These worlds through digital media, interactive virtual environments, and dapps.




### The problems to solve
Yet community-led and owned, open-source design research activity does not exist.<br> nor 
there are no token incentives in place to reward contributors.<br>
What questions this project will answer<br>
How to design the future of web3? <br>
How to explore the potential of web3 to its fullest extent?
together with the community?<br> participate in the
and How to avoid the biases of the few when exploring the plausible futures of web3 that can be made available? <br>
How can communities leverage the programmable web3 to bring future realities into existence?<br>
How can we help society envision solutions to long-term global challenges, get exposure, and experience future realities?<br>
How can we form our world into the one we want rather than the one that may be available to us in the face of mass challenges?<br>
### How this project will answer these questions
The decentralized Worldbuilding and visual language.<br>

There are three main motivations as to why we need to explore the potential of web3 to its full extent, why use a decentralized worldbuilding method to do it, and the new incentives mechanism.

## THE THREE MOTIVATIONS TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF WEB3
#### Web3 has become a future reality-based system. Any world we prototype we can create. <br>
Programmable Web3 can edit, re-program, and redesign components, systems, and interactions that make up social, economic, and political systems. 
Web3 versions of established institutions running on the internet as coded protocols are now possible. Primary protocols form assemblies of organizational structures that can create the operating system of an entire city. <br>

#### Web3 systems can provoke themselves into existence
"Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade." This demonstrates that in the online world of the internet, web3 systems can provoke themselves into existence. 
Because social consensus and economic incentives are embedded into their design and enforced at deployment, web3 systems create decentralized networks that grow autonomously.
The next level is to explore if it is possible to create Cyber to physical systems that scale. [...are obvious]

#### The community has become a disrupting force. 
The community has the potential to play a key role in society, given that they are involved in the design and depiction of complex, web3 alternative realities set in the future. 
The experiment goes beyond user-centric worlds, to re-imagine the role of the community and explore our place within the visions of our Web3 futures to ensure fairness.

Web3 institutions and cyber to physical systems have a wide range of applications that could transform society and the global economy. 

### SYNTHETIC WEB3 WORLDS 

Web3 experimental environments<br>
Web3 Synthetic Worlds are unique and unparallel experimental environments. <br>
With the use of narratives we can... 
Building prototypes of these worlds will enable communities and organizations to envision, experience, and explore desirable realities. for exploring and interacting with alternative futures for businesses and governments.  <br>

#### Web3 world system
web3 protocols create the world system that allows the world to function, evolve and grow. In these "world prototypes" what could happen in the future is based on what protocols are deployed, and what is happening in the present.  
This world-building process employs narratives design within a container constructed with the technological framework of web3. 
World building prototypes would allow communities to make sense of these futuristic worlds and take the necessary steps now to realize these futures.


In doing so, they allow us to not just tinker with the status quo, but to dismantle it and build something better in its place. 
Building projective futures we can show people that other realities are possible and that web3 can help us get there. If we can show that web3  can help to create a brighter future and we map the path to it, we will all rush towards that outcome or not.

#### A web3 world is a coordination system
Envisioning these worlds and the novel possibilities becoming available can serve as a coordination mechanism to demonstrate how web3 can become a central component of plausible futures. 

#### A web3 world is a map toward a future state
Worlds serve as a map of how to arrive at the future from the current state.

#### A DECENTRALIZED AGENCY FOR THE FUTURE 
Collective against biased  
Decentralized participation is at the core of this experiment. In this era of unprecedented change, no single organization can begin to design unexpected solutions that disrupt conventional thinking without deep collaboration between the various types of users, communities, and local governance.

### TOKENIZING INCENTIVES AND OUR DESIRE TO CREATE CHANGE: A MECHANISM TO ATTRACT TALENT AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION

  
#### Introducing Token incentives to attract talent and fund works
Because web3 is not a blockchain it doesnâ€™t offer the same reward mechanisms or token incentives to contributors as blockchains, applications or L2s can. However, designing the future of web3 still needs to attract talent.
If we believe web3 empowers communities to design and form their future, then it is important to put in place incentives to attract talent to start working on the creation of prototypes and web3 worlds.
