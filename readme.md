# Future Web3 World Vision.
## Introduction
### To build the future, first, we must visualize it.


#### 1. Collective Decentralized Participation
This project proposes to the community to participate in the creation of "Future Web3-World Vision" through integrated storytelling that takes place on-chain. <br> Each digital asset, serves as part of the storytelling process allowing fans to shape their own scenario for the future and be a part of the story.<br>

#### 2. Future World Systems Design
Web3 Worlds Vision is not science fiction. The world system is built around a network of web3 institutions that form the rules of the future world. The interactions of people with the institutions create societies that exhibit a multitude of complex behaviours under different conditions. These new worlds are future realities because the starting conditions are anchored in the current state and they evolve based on the design of the institutions. 

#### 3. Programmable Web3 has become a future reality system. Any world we prototype we can create in the digital realm. <br>
In a virtual environment, Programmable Web3 can edit, re-program, and redesign components, systems, and interactions that make up social, economic, and political systems. It is now possible to create Web3 versions of established institutions that run on the internet as coded protocols. Using these "code-blocks" we can form policies to power the operations of an entire city. Programming digital institutions with Web3 we can assembly the operating system of entire digital worlds.

##### 4. Web3 is an innovation built on top of blockchains
Short description of web3's potential and why is worth exploring. what is believed that it can deliver

##### 3.1 Explore the potential of web3 to deliver solutions to global challenges. What is web3, why and how. Humans at the center
Web3 Worlds Vision introduces multiple plausible worlds and their evolution from 2022 to 2070. <br><br>

##### 3.2 What futures to design

##### 4. Explore the capacity of community to provoke change

##### 5. Deliverables. Benefits for participants
Each world produces multiple outcomes accross platforms. 

## Project Rationale

##### 1. Why explore web3 potential
The idea that web3  can inform the design of alternative futures, and that communities can use web3 systems to provoke desired realities into existence is a powerful one to explore. 
##### 1. How to explore
the TINKCAN TOKEN, a design research pilot exploring the potential and capacity of the programmable web3 to inform the strategic design of, and transition towards, collective futures that are good for the Earth: climate-positive worlds, super cities ... are obvious futures
 interactive cyber-physical policy systems 




We can experience These worlds through digital media, interactive virtual environments, and dapps.

### The problems to solve
Yet community-led and owned, open-source design research activity does not exist.<br> nor 
there are no token incentives in place to reward contributors.<br>
What questions this project will answer<br>
How to design the future of web3? <br>
How to explore the potential of web3 to its fullest extent?
together with the community?<br> participate in the
and How to avoid the biases of the few when exploring the plausible futures of web3 that can be made available? <br>
How can communities leverage the programmable web3 to bring future realities into existence?<br>
How can we help society envision solutions to long-term global challenges, get exposure, and experience future realities?<br>
How can we form our world into the one we want rather than the one that may be available to us in the face of mass challenges?<br>
### How this project will answer these questions
The decentralized Worldbuilding and visual language.<br>

There are three main motivations as to why we need to explore the potential of web3 to its full extent, why use a decentralized worldbuilding method to do it, and the new incentives mechanism.

## THE THREE MOTIVATIONS TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF WEB3
#### Web3 has become a future reality-based system. Any world we prototype we can create. <br>
Programmable Web3 can edit, re-program, and redesign components, systems, and interactions that make up social, economic, and political systems. 
Web3 versions of established institutions running on the internet as coded protocols are now possible. Primary protocols form assemblies of organizational structures that can create the operating system of an entire city. <br>

#### Web3 systems can provoke themselves into existence
"Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade." This demonstrates that in the online world of the internet, web3 systems can provoke themselves into existence. 
Because social consensus and economic incentives are embedded into their design and enforced at deployment, web3 systems create decentralized networks that grow autonomously.
The next level is to explore if it is possible to create Cyber to physical systems that scale. [...are obvious]

#### The community has become a disrupting force. 
The community has the potential to play a key role in society, given that they are involved in the design and depiction of complex, web3 alternative realities set in the future. 
The experiment re-imagines the role of the community and explore our place within the visions of our Web3 futures to ensure fairness.

Web3 institutions and cyber to physical systems have a wide range of applications that could transform society and the global economy. 

### SYNTHETIC WEB3 WORLDS 
##### Intro
Web3 Synthetic Worlds pair language and Narrative with programmable blocks. This combination creates a unique and unparallel experimental environment that does not exist in other simulation systems except from digital games. They enable the testing of socio-economic and political systems at scale. With the use of language and narratives we can transition the world from one state to another.<br>
Example: What conversations can emerge in...<br> These properties are unique among simulation environments and enable the testing of large scale projects before the project is built.<br>

Building prototypes of these worlds will enable communities and organizations to envision, experience, and explore desirable realities. and take the necessary steps now to realize these futures.<br>

##### Web3 world system
web3 protocols create the world system that allows the world to function, evolve and grow. In these "world prototypes" what could happen in the future is based on what protocols are deployed, and what is happening in the present.  
This world-building process employs narratives design within a container constructed with the technological framework of web3. 


In doing so, they allow us to not just tinker with the status quo, but to dismantle it and build something better in its place. 
Building projective futures we can show people that other realities are possible and that web3 can help us get there. If we can show that web3  can help to create a brighter future and we map the path to it, we will all rush towards that outcome or not.

##### A web3 world is a coordination system
Envisioning these worlds and the novel possibilities becoming available can serve as a coordination mechanism to demonstrate how web3 can become a central component of plausible futures. 

##### A web3 world is a map toward a future state
Worlds serve as a map of how to arrive at the future from the current state.
